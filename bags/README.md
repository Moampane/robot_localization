#### Gauntlet Bag
This bag was collected using teleop controls, the neato simulator, and in the provided gauntlet map. The particle filter worked effectively to find the actual location of the robot in the neato simulator.

#### mac_take_1_bag
Running the macfirst_floor_take_1 bag and recording it made this bag. The starting pose was accurate to the robot and the particle filter worked well.

#### mac_take_2_bag
Using the macfirst_floor_take_2, bag mac_take_2_bag was recorded. The starting pose was inaccurate but the particle filter eventually found the correct robot location.
