# Computational Intro to Robotics: Robot Localization
Authors: [Mo Ampane](https://github.com/Moampane) & Dokyun Kim

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to implement a particle filter for robot localization using ROS2 in Python.

## Methodology
This project can be separated into 5 main steps  
1. Initializing the particle cloud
2. Updating the particle's location using the robot's odometry
3. Updating the particle's weight using the robot's laser scan data
4. Updating the robot's position based on the particle's weights
5. Resampling the particles

## Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.
